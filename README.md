# bitmap_transformer

## How to use
Navigate to the bitmap_transformer folder. On the command line, type 'node index.js'. The next two command line arguments are the input file and the output file, respectively.

The default color transform is 'greenify', but if you want to alter that, you can use the '-t' command line arg to change the transform. Possible transforms include 'greenify', 'blueify', 'darken', 'redden', and 'flip'.

Alternatively, you can specify input/output file names by using the -i or -o commands, respectively.
